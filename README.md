# Eat-Ur-Veggiez üçÖ

## TL; DR

This project was my second game I developed alone, while asset design were created by a designer friend

The game is a roguelike mobile game 

The mission is to survive as much as possible while each round more and more enemies created and become stronger.

The game is unfinished and the last goal will include: 

1. Random maps and traps (check my "First Rougelike game" for design idea)
2. More players, enemies attacks and animations
3. Acheivement system
4. Items system
5. UI
